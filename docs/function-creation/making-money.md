# Making Money

## Pricing

To set up pricing and start making money, check out our [pricing docs](../function-creation/pricing.md).

## Getting Paid

Currently, we have no integration for a payment pipeline (in the works). Rather, at the end of each month we will run a check on those users who have a positive balance on their account. If your account is owed a credit, the bantam team will contact you regarding your billing and other pertinant tax information. **We only pay out when you are owed more than $25.**

If you have any questions regarding your account, please contact <team@bantam.io>
